Using basic Mocha specs

assert:    The word 'assert' aids in determining the test status. It determines whether or not the test was successful.

describe: 'describe' is a function that holds a collection of tests,or a test suite as we might call it. 
           It has two parameters: the first is a descriptive name that describes the method's usefulness,
           The second is a function: which basically comprises one or more tests. It's also possible to specify a nested 'describe'.

it:       It's a function that contains the actual test or test steps that must be run.It also has two parameters:
          The first is the test's meaningful name,
          and the second is the function, which contains the test's body or stages.
